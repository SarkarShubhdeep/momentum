# Date and Time Picker Implementation

## Overview

The date and time picker functionality has been successfully implemented in the `AddTaskBar` component. This allows users to select both a date and time for their tasks, with intelligent default behavior.

## Features

### Date Picker

-   **Component**: Uses the existing `Calendar` component from `@/components/ui/calendar`
-   **UI**: Popover-based date selection
-   **Format**: Displays selected date as "MMM dd" (e.g., "Dec 25")
-   **State**: Shows blue background when date is selected
-   **Integration**: Automatically formats date as 'yyyy-MM-dd' for database storage
-   **Smart Default**: When only time is selected, automatically uses today's date

### Time Picker

-   **Component**: Custom time picker with hour, minute, and AM/PM selection
-   **UI**: Three scrollable lists for hours (1-12), minutes (00-59), and AM/PM
-   **Format**: 12-hour format with AM/PM (displays as "2:30 PM")
-   **Storage**: Converts to 24-hour format internally for database storage
-   **State**: Shows blue background when time is selected
-   **Integration**: Stores time as string in 'HH:MM' format (24-hour)
-   **User Experience**: Time picker stays open while selecting, only closes when "Done" is clicked
-   **Visual Feedback**: Selected hour, minute, and AM/PM are highlighted, with live preview of selected time

### Additional Features

-   **Clear Button**: Appears when either date or time is selected
-   **Category Clear**: X button appears when a category is selected
-   **Priority Clear**: X button appears when a priority other than "None" is selected
-   **Visual Feedback**: Selected values are highlighted with blue background
-   **Form Reset**: Date and time are cleared when a new task is added
-   **Database Integration**: Values are properly formatted and sent to the task service
-   **Smart Date Logic**: Selecting only time defaults to today's date automatically

## Implementation Details

### State Management

```typescript
const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState<Date | undefined>(undefined);
const [selectedTime, setSelectedTime] = useState<string>("");
const [isDatePickerOpen, setIsDatePickerOpen] = useState(false);
const [isTimePickerOpen, setIsTimePickerOpen] = useState(false);
```

### Key Functions

-   `handleTimeSelect(hour: string, minute: string)`: Handles time selection
-   `clearDateTime()`: Clears both date and time selections
-   `format(selectedDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd')`: Formats date for database storage

### Smart Date Logic

The system intelligently handles date selection:

-   If both date and time are selected → Uses the selected date
-   If only time is selected → Automatically uses today's date
-   If only date is selected → Uses the selected date (no time)
-   If neither is selected → No date/time stored

### Dependencies Used

-   `react-day-picker`: For date picker functionality
-   `date-fns`: For date formatting
-   `@radix-ui/react-popover`: For popover UI components
-   `lucide-react`: For icons

## Usage

1. Click the "Date" button to open the date picker
2. Click the "Time" button to open the time picker
3. Select hour and minute from the scrollable lists (picker stays open)
4. See live preview of selected time at the top of the picker
5. Click "Done" to confirm and close the time picker
6. **Smart Behavior**: If you select only time, the date will automatically be set to today
7. Use the "Clear" button to reset selections
8. Selected values are automatically included when creating a new task

## Database Integration

The selected date and time are properly formatted and included in the task creation payload:

-   `task_date`: Formatted as 'yyyy-MM-dd' string (today's date if only time selected)
-   `task_only_time`: Formatted as 'HH:MM' string

Both fields are optional and will be `undefined` if not selected.

## Visual Indicators

-   Date button shows "Today" when only time is selected
-   Both date and time buttons show blue background when they have values
-   Time button displays time in 12-hour format (e.g., "2:30 PM")
-   Clear button appears as outlined button with X icon when there's a date or time selection
-   Category input shows X button when a category is selected
-   Priority input shows X button when a priority other than "None" is selected
